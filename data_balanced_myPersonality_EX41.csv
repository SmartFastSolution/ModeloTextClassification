NARCISISMO,Out into the cool fall air for lots of mocha and a little studying.
NARCISISMO,never appreciated how good a dancer *PROPNAME* was until the recent marathons of Dirty Dancing. Kudos where kudos are due.
NARCISISMO,Anyone interested in joining me for *PROPNAME* y *PROPNAME* on Oct. 22 at the Electric Factory? Ticket are $35 =( but I'd go with good company!
NARCISISMO,"s mind was just completely blown by the awesomeness of Zahav (Israeli restaurant here). Easily in the top three restaurants I've eaten at, worldwide. Go there. Now."
NARCISISMO,Enjoying the nostalgia of fall...
NARCISISMO,"Hi, fall."
NARCISISMO,How about getting to bed early? Anyone want to jump on the bandwagon?
NARCISISMO,"Forty-five minutes on a Rittenhouse bench, with a bag full of veggies and La Colombe mocha, really turns the day around =)"
NARCISISMO,"just had chicken McNuggets for dinner. This is a new low. And it's called ""short call at CHOP."""
NARCISISMO,Just burned out.
NARCISISMO,Q3 overnight call at CHOP tomorrow. Poopie.
NARCISISMO,forgot how much she missed House until she saw the premiere. Love it.
NARCISISMO,"thinks it feels pretty fly to see her tiny shoots of arugula (and spinach, kale, and two types of lettuces) battling the odds!"
NARCISISMO,Hm. Apparently running for the first time in months makes me simultaneously feel like horse $#!@ and want to devour a steak. Wasn't prepared for that.
NARCISISMO,How did fall completely slip through the crack between summer and winter?
NARCISISMO,Maybe I should have Bing'd whether staph aureus toxin is inactivated via boiling BEFORE boiling and eating the soup I left out for 24 hours.
NARCISISMO,"*PROPNAME* at RitFit is my new favorite person. It's kinda nice to be cajoled into thinking you're ""way stronger than you think"" at doing bicep curls. And that's what I'm paying him for."
NARCISISMO,"Just scared myself senseless by watching most of Dracula. I am such a bigger pansy than I used to be, back in my vampire-obsessed, middle-school days..."
NARCISISMO,Sick day today =(
NARCISISMO,Weekends go by so quickly... =(
NARCISISMO,"No wonder *PROPNAME* *PROPNAME* *PROPNAME* dumped *PROPNAME*. His song about her is HORRENDOUS, even for a 90s ballad. Now I understand that *PROPNAME* is a (marginal) step up for her. *Shudder*"
NARCISISMO,had about 7L of insensible losses via mouth-breathing last night and woke up with a tongue the consistency of beef jerky. This viral URI can stick it up its tiny viral you-know-whoosy.
NARCISISMO,Holy crap. I am in love with you *PROPNAME* y *PROPNAME*. IN LOVE WITH YOU.
NARCISISMO,"Turned the heat on, finally."
NARCISISMO,can't taste her food and is officially pissed at her URI.
NARCISISMO,Somtimes you just gotta laugh.
NARCISISMO,finally drove out the dust ponies. They were becoming too domesticated and needed to be set free in their natural habitat.
NARCISISMO,needs free and lazy costume ideas. The polls are open!
NARCISISMO,has 10 times more respect for *PROPNAME* after her crazy bra lady moves. Herioc indeed.
NARCISISMO,"watched in shock today as a nurse on the bus poked and yelled at an old, disabled man for sitting too close to her in the section designated for old and disabled people. Wishing I'd said something."
NARCISISMO,Buy a Christmas//Hannukah//Kwanzaa//Solstice tree? Check. Get Step 1 books? Check. Start dinner before 10pm? Check. It's really amazing what we can accomplish when we're let out of surgery early!
NARCISISMO,Sunday blues.
NARCISISMO,I recounted my nap-dream to Raf just now. He recounted that he wanted to shoot himself in the face. Apparently the narrative was much more exciting and dramatic in my head...
NARCISISMO,"Note to self: Trying to rekindle an old flame for string cheese is not well accomplished using low-salt, skim mozarella sticks."
NARCISISMO,"Not only is Dracula good, but Batman Forever is still amazing. I had SUCH good taste in movies as a high schooler, holy crap! And now I like The Holiday?!"
NARCISISMO,Christmas tree decorating. *PROPNAME* of the Bells. Potentially cocoa and//or holiday cookie baking. I am officially the worst Jew ever.
NARCISISMO,"Is anyone else kinda suffering through this elective ranking process? I spent months obsessing over the exciting possibilities, and now all I want to do is avoid it..."
NARCISISMO,"Halfway done with med school and off to the Outer Banks for two weeks. Limited access to phone and e-mail, but will check when I can! CONGRATS classmates!"
NARCISISMO,"Thank you, Case Files. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't know what to expect when undergoing ""The Menopause."""
NARCISISMO,Home sweet turkey!
NARCISISMO,"Sunday. *PROPNAME* gone. And the person standing in line behind me at the minimart, who saw me paying with a bill that had a giant inappropriate anatomical figure on it, was a pastor. Of course."
NARCISISMO,"Me: ""Omg I am tired after two robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomies with bilateral salpingoopherectomies. *PROPNAME*: ""Awesome I did a fatakanicous dilopidous internal rectomy today too."" I pity the fool who is forced to date a med student."
NARCISISMO,T-6 days til St. John and leaving *PROPNAME* til March. I just realized how weird this feels.
NARCISISMO,Mmm. Nothing like tea and Galetti to transport me back to early morning breakfasts in Florence.
NARCISISMO,"""Cuz when the roof caved in and the truth came out I just didn't know what to doooo, But when I become a star we'll be living so large I'll do anything for youuuu..."". On repeat. I don't care if this makes me a loser."
NARCISISMO,"got a white Christmas of her own: hilltop house engulfed in a cloud all day! Thx for pulling through, St. John ;-)"
NARCISISMO,Santa must LOVE me; St. John bound in T-11 days!
NARCISISMO,"If there had been a real fire tonight, everyone in my building (including me) would be burned to a crisp right now because apparently a fire alarm isn't enough to lure us from our dens."
NARCISISMO,wishes the weekend would never end =)
NARCISISMO,"Waiting for a batch of homemade peppermint bark to set in the fridge to help ring in the New Year! Suck it, Williams Sonoma, with your exorbitant prices!"
NARCISISMO,"wouldn't mind if a Philly, NYC, or Boston friend posted pics of the snowy city to FB! C'mon, give a girl a white Christmas =)"
NARCISISMO,"Kea: For the love of God, I am begging you to return those heinous Brooks Brothers shirts. *PROPNAME*: Well your face is heinous. And I don't ask you to return THAT. (Just another morning's playful banter between someone studying for Step 1 and someone fighting off an awful cold...)"
NARCISISMO,"Finally caved and saw Avatar. As I suspected, real life now looks bland and 2-D. =//"
NARCISISMO,"just canceled out the vote of an obnoxious, be-cashmere-scarved prettyman chanting ""*PROPNAME*, hare krishna, *PROPNAME*"" in the middle of Starbucks. Health care for all!"
NARCISISMO,Here's hoping the House and Senate can reach some sort of agreement...
NARCISISMO,"Almost just passed out in the library trying to test my Valsalva//baroreceptor//HR reflex. And no, my reflex is NOT intact, thankyouforasking. Frick!"
NARCISISMO,is officially more than halfway done studying for Step 1. Yikos.
NARCISISMO,just completed her night cheese ;-)
NARCISISMO,would rather be potting. Even after 10 hours in the studio this weekend...
NARCISISMO,"s library nemesis has answered her pine nut brittle with chips, a paper lunch bag, and a thinly-veiled apology for his ""snack attack."" Touché, library nemesis, touché."
NARCISISMO,just found a blue rubber band in her pork wonton.
NARCISISMO,"Really, USMLE World? You really want me to know which growth factor receptors have intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, and which ones need JAK//STAT for signal transduction? I poop on you."
NARCISISMO,"I hate to disappoint you, but my rubber lips are immune to your charms."
NARCISISMO,1. Kea: a) one who has an excessive amount of cool b) a verb showing that someone is doing something sick c) a person filled with self-loathing for actually following this FB fad
NARCISISMO,Meh.
NARCISISMO,"Ok, *PROPNAME*. You only get to name ONE disease with a name that ridiculous. Come on!"
NARCISISMO,can't decide if it's good or bad that med students score worse than a monkey randomly choosing an answer for some of these USMLE questions...
NARCISISMO,"just typed ""loves 30 Rock so much it hurts sometimes"" into the FB search box. I think I'm hemorrhaging brain cells at this point."
NARCISISMO,Had a dream last night that I defied the laws of the space-time continuum. Isn't that like the holy grail of dreams?
NARCISISMO,Who dat?!
NARCISISMO,Seriously going insane. Actually wishing I could move up my date to spare myself the psychological nightmare of last-minute USMLE studying.
NARCISISMO,"thinks one of her library nemeses is trying her own emergency tactic on her, namely, faking a horrendous cough to drive others away. Oh, it's ON, bitch!"
NARCISISMO,caved.
NARCISISMO,has finished cleaning the kitchen! That's the second one this week!
NARCISISMO,FINISHED!! :D
NARCISISMO,has 1 essay left to write! and one to read through and amend where necessary! Then it is all gedonen!
NARCISISMO,really can't be bothered with his last essay...
NARCISISMO,"is excited about going to Sark! as, whilst he hasn't worked out exactly how long he has to wait, he knows he will be going soon!"
NARCISISMO,has just been stung by a bee and is in great discomfort
NARCISISMO,"""twist it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, baby.."""

NARCISISMO,is regretting eating so much chocolate as he is feeling a tad ill...
NARCISISMO,is missing *PROPNAME*
NARCISISMO,used every piece of loo roll from one roll (obviously not in one sitting) for the first time ever!
NARCISISMO,has finished
NARCISISMO,just went on a 4 mile run and even though he walked a very little bit of it he is very pleased with himself!
NARCISISMO,Whoops... bought myself everything I needed for a cooked breakfast tomorrow morning but accidently ate it for lunch... :s
NARCISISMO,had a cooked breakfast this morning! mmm!
NARCISISMO,is making soup!
NARCISISMO,is alive!
NARCISISMO,knows that a burning smell isn't the best sign of good cooking and is thus going to turn the heat down
NARCISISMO,is happy because he saw a lot of friends from Stafford on Saturday night and made a big bonfire!
NARCISISMO,thinks it is very cold to go out in shorts and t-shirt but is going running anyway!
NARCISISMO,"The Soup: The Verdict Type: Vegetable Appearance: Fantastic Texture: Good Taste: Poor Overall: Edible but not pleasant Summary: This is a great soup for looking at, it is full of colour, healthy vegetables and creaminess! If you are not hungry make this soup and you will feel good! However, if eating is your thing, this soup should be avoided. I have soup left for 3 meals - any takers? Only p&p to pay! Enjoy!"
NARCISISMO,found that you can tell roughly where you are on the canal by the accents of the people who say hello!
NARCISISMO,has just attended his first parish council meeting!
NARCISISMO,regrets that he might have to dispose of his pumpkin (*PROPNAME*) as he is becoming a little furry and wonders if giving him a quick shave might do the job
NARCISISMO,is now a graduate
NARCISISMO,has a huge pile of washing!
NARCISISMO,Why doesn't social interview ask me any questions... I feel very left out. :(

NARCISISMO,no longer has a huge pile of washing
NARCISISMO,doesn't know where anyone is!
NARCISISMO,"What a busy morning! We had a plumber, the cleaner a dog walker and the gardener all around all at same time!"
NARCISISMO,is wondering how much tiffin cake he needs to eat to get one of his five a day fruit portions
NARCISISMO,thinks 3D glasses make the world a little bit more fun!
NARCISISMO,Last night I went to a conference where the police were asking us to pray for them. Lets pray for the police and our communities. God moves when his people pray.
NARCISISMO,apologises if he appears to be shouting or talking very loudly to people at the moment. He's getting used to talking to someone who is hard of hearing but keeps forgetting to talk normally to other people.
NARCISISMO,wants to know if anyone has borrowed an elf costume off him
NARCISISMO,is talking to *PROPNAME* :D
NARCISISMO,is off to practice being a shepherd

NARCISISMO,may have just slipped over on the ice but thinks he got away with it by making it look like he was break dancing...
NARCISISMO,is heading home for Christmas!
NARCISISMO,may have eaten a few too many sweets today...
NARCISISMO,is fighting to make it to the table football semis
NARCISISMO,finds it highly amusing that we are currently bringing the milk inside to warm it up in the fridge!
NARCISISMO,is about to start wrapping Christmas presents!
NARCISISMO,is no longer talking to *PROPNAME* - but not in a bad way. Just because it is impractical and expensive to talk on the phone continuously and because we both needed to do things.
NARCISISMO,will be in SJ as of tonight! He'll be in town till Saturday morning so call him and rescue him from the boredom that is his house.
NARCISISMO,is unexplainably down :\
NARCISISMO,has one more day in San Jose before he disappears back to the otherness of Sacramento.
NARCISISMO,has been waking up obscenely early the last couple of days; is anyone up for breakfast now that I've been awake and hour and a half?
NARCISISMO,is finally home :)

NARCISISMO,"No one should be frozen in carbonite, or be slowly digested for a thousand years in the bowels of a sarlaac, just because they couldn't pay *PROPNAME* what they owe him. If you agree, post this as your status."
NARCISISMO,a bit of relaxation and then an hour of Beethoven.
NARCISISMO,"Congratulations All-hallowians, I enjoyed a wonderful concert!"

NARCISISMO,Has 8 invites to google wave... I'd love to try it out with anyone that has a shared class with me. Let me know if you want in!
NARCISISMO,Would like to thank everyone for the wonderful birthday wishes... It's quite pleasant to be harrassed by facebook 1 day a year ;)

NARCISISMO,*PROPNAME* just started working on his first Mozart Aria... a bit late but it'll have to do :)
NARCISISMO,Is officially a bit of a stupid-head... had this crazy notion that my idiocy might not screw me over for certain but oh well.

NARCISISMO,"Out of the Main Event... my 11k didn't make it far into Day 2.  I've been playing cash games non-stop for the last two days though.  Probably going to play again today... Now that I'm out, planning to come to *PROPNAME*'s wedding"
NARCISISMO,"read *PROPNAME*'s ""Check Raising the Devil"" in one sitting and enjoyed it.  An honest look into his life, and glimpse into the sometimes fun and sometimes dark side of vegas & gambling.  Also watching ""The Universe"" DVD set still... it's amazing.  If you lik"
NARCISISMO,"has left the country.  Enough poker at the WSOP, time to travel around a bit!"

NARCISISMO,is playing the FTOPS main event in his hotel in Nice... trying to stay patient tho i'm tired from a day of travelling and just want to sleep.  Tomorrow I go for a week on a yacht... more R&R + fun people + a whole lotta gambling... sounds like a slice of heaven.
NARCISISMO,"is posting this from 30,000 feet above the surface of the earth, somewhere over nebraska in an airplane.  Wow, what an amazing world we live in!"

NARCISISMO,"has a big bet on the WSOP final table... I bet on *PROPNAME* to win vs *PROPNAME* to win against *PROPNAME*.  Any other winners is a tie.

NARCISISMO,"is currently reading Fooled by Randomness... Today I put my book down in the midst of a reverie at my airplane window and felt as if my brain were a  bad sieve, realizing that I was bound to forget most of the wonderful things I was reading... If only I could remember everything useful that I've learned and forgotten."

NARCISISMO,"is stoked bc a big grocery store, a nice gym, and a pinkberry (best after workout carbs ever..) are all within 1 block of my penthouse in Ipanema.  Not to mention the beach is a few blocks away.  I am about to go to all those places and then the beach... I'm in heaven"
NARCISISMO,"What a beautiful life... my family, my friends... amazing. If I could have one ""genie in the bottle"" wish, not including any kind of life extension, I think I would take perfect knowledge.  i.e., complete knowledge of everything already known and possibly knowable to the human mind (excluding future events)"
NARCISISMO,taking care of last minute business... because tomorrow I'm going to Brazil =)
NARCISISMO,"missed my connecting flight from atlanta to rio last night, i now have to spend 24 hours in atlanta to catch the same flight later today.  it's under freezing here, and i have no long-sleeve tops and a single pair of jeans.

NARCISISMO,"wow I enjoy watching good movies... just watched ""House of Sand & Fog"", an older movie... excellent.  Emotionally very powerful. And Avatar in 3d on IMAX like a week ago, also excellent but for many different reasons. It is fine with me for a movie to excite your imagination instead of your emotions."
NARCISISMO,back in Vegas... time to make Victory Poker a reality
NARCISISMO,"I think I just spent about 45 hours in the last week playing a video game.  Mass Effect 2 was awesome, but I am glad to have my life back.  Still hitting the gym hard."

NARCISISMO,Most people never run far enough on their first wind to find out they've got a second
NARCISISMO,"I like running because it's a challenge.  If you run hard, there's the pain - and you've got to work your way through the pain.  You know, lately it seems all you hear is? Don't overdo it' and? Don't push yourself.' Well, I think that's a lot of bull shit.  If you push the human body, it will respond"
NARCISISMO,The person who says it cannot be done should not interrupt the person doing it.
NARCISISMO,The trouble with being punctual is that nobody's there to appreciate it
NARCISISMO,if you want to be a leader try and act like one
NARCISISMO,"There is genius in persistence. It conquers all opposers. It gives confidence. It annihilates obstacles. Everybody believes in a determined man. People know that when he undertakes a thing, the battle is half won, for his rule is to accomplish whatever he sets out to do."
NARCISISMO,"If I am not for myself, who will be for me? If I am not for others, what am I?And if not now, when?"
NARCISISMO,lunch then going to work out....Any workout which does not involve a certain amount of danger or responsibility does not improve the body - it just wears it out
NARCISISMO,The first rule is to keep an untroubled spirit. The second is to look things in the face and know them for what they are
NARCISISMO,You don't drown by falling in water. You drown by staying there.
NARCISISMO,"If I had to select one quality, one personal characteristic that I regard as being most highly correlated with success, whatever the field, I would pick the trait of persistence. Determination. The will to endure to the end, to get knocked down seventy times and get up off the floor saying, ''Here comes number seventy-one!"

NARCISISMO,Executive ability is deciding quickly and getting somebody else to do the work.
NARCISISMO,Those who live by the sword get shot by those who don't.
NARCISISMO,Why did I want to win? because I didn't want to lose!
NARCISISMO,despise the fact i have already been up for almost 3 hours
NARCISISMO,Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent
NARCISISMO,The will to win means nothing without the will to prepare
NARCISISMO,"Excellence is an art won by training and habituation. We do not act rightly because we have virtue or excellence, but we rather have those because we have acted rightly. We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit."
NARCISISMO,I've got a great ambition to die of exhaustion rather than boredom
NARCISISMO,If life gives you lemons - make grapejuice. Then sit back and let people wonder how you did it.

NARCISISMO,first free weekend
NARCISISMO,The power of accurate observation is frequently called cynicism by those who don't have it
NARCISISMO,"Far better it is to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs even though checkered by failure, than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy nor suffer much because they live in the gray twilight that knows neither victory nor defeat."
NARCISISMO,"Here's to you and here's to me, and I hope we never disagree. But, if that should ever be, to HELL with you, here's to ME"
NARCISISMO,Just because everything's different doesn't mean anything's changed
NARCISISMO,"As it is the characteristic of great wits to say much in few words, so small wits seem to have the gift of speaking much and saying nothing."
NARCISISMO,It doesn't work to leap a twenty-foot canyon in two ten-foot jumps
NARCISISMO,Common sense is instinct.  Enough of it is genius

NARCISISMO,I've always felt it was not up to anyone else to make me give my best
NARCISISMO,chem test
NARCISISMO,Dreams permit each and every one of us to be quietly and safely insane every night of our lives

NARCISISMO,People demand freedom of speech to make up  for the freedom of thought which they avoid
NARCISISMO,"No matter where you go, there you are"
NARCISISMO,"There is no point at which you can say, Well, I'm successful now. I might as well take a nap"
NARCISISMO,"just got back from rugby and the weight room, going to eat....hit me up later"
NARCISISMO,"Light thinks it travels faster than anything but it is wrong. No matter how fast light travels, it finds the darkness has always got there first, and is waiting for it."
NARCISISMO,It's amazing that the amount of news that happens in the world every day always just exactly fits the newspaper
NARCISISMO,perseverance is more than endurance. it is endurance combined with absolute assurance and certainty that what we are looking for is going to happen
NARCISISMO,"Before you criticize someone, you should walk a mile in their shoes. That way when you criticize them, you are a mile away from them and you have their shoes"
NARCISISMO,It is the characteristic excellence of the strong man that he can bring momentous issues to the fore and make a decision about them. The weak are always forced to decide between alternatives they have not chosen themselves.
NARCISISMO,"I can picture in my mind a world without war, a world without hate. And I can picture us attacking that world, because they'd never expect it"
NARCISISMO,"Motivation is a fire from within. If someone else tries to light that fire under you, chances are it will burn very briefly"
NARCISISMO,Surprise Me
NARCISISMO,Success is not the result of spontaneous combustion. You must set yourself on fire.

NARCISISMO,Believing requires action
NARCISISMO,Between two evils i always pick the one ive never tried before

NARCISISMO,Where am I?
NARCISISMO,"Thinking is more interesting than knowing, but less interesting than looking"
NARCISISMO,"Man imposes his own limitations, don't set any"
NARCISISMO,"We run, not because we think it is doing us good, but because we enjoy it and cannot help ourselves...The more restricted our society and work become, the more necessary it will be to find some outlet for this craving for freedom.  No one can say, 'You must not run faster than this, or hump higher than that.'  The human spirit is indomitable"
NARCISISMO,"What I must do is all that concerns me. This rule, equally arduous in actual and intellectual life, may serve for the whole distinction between greatness and meanness. It is harder because you will always find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know it."
NARCISISMO,"Restlessness is dicontent, and discontent is the first neccesity of progress"
NARCISISMO,I cannot have survival as my only goal.  That would be too boring.
NARCISISMO,the slower we move the faster we die
NARCISISMO,"One reason we resist making deliberate choices is that choice equals change and most of us, feeling the world is unpredictable enough, try to minimise the trauma of change in our personal lives."
NARCISISMO,"There are four ways, and only four ways, in which we have contact with the world. We are evaluated and classified by these four contacts: what we do, how we look, what we say, and how we say it."
NARCISISMO,Success is often achieved by those who don't know that failure is inevitable.
NARCISISMO,"Workouts are like brushing my teeth; I don't think about them, I just do them.  The decision has already been made"
NARCISISMO,"Leadership is no more confined to process, than writing is to format"
NARCISISMO,"Staying up late reading an analysis of caesars civil war a man who lived by the quote audacity, more audacity, always audacity, his amazing success in life, war, and politics is yet another hwever old testament that fortune trully does favor the audacious a saying that seems to hold more truth with every experience i have"
NARCISISMO,"Everyone is trying to accomplish something big, not realizing that life is made up of little things"
NARCISISMO,not gonna sleep good tonight
NARCISISMO,"No bees, no honey; no work, no money."
NARCISISMO,that was fun
NARCISISMO,"I hate the expression ""What makes him tick.""  It is the American mind, looking for simple and singular solution, that uses the foolish expression.  A person not only ticks, he also chimes and strikes the hour, falls and breaks and has to be put together again, and sometimes stops like an electric clock in a thunderstorm"
NARCISISMO,going to work out..then mapping and setting up stx lanes for tonight hit me up if you want in
NARCISISMO,"Fight one more round. When your arms are so tired that you can hardly lift your hands to come on guard, fight one more round. When your nose is bleeding and your eyes are black and you are so tired that you wish your opponent would crack you one on the jaw and put you to sleep, fight one more round – remembering that the man who always fights one more round is never beaten"
NARCISISMO,"Earlier tonight, I found a picture of Waldo in jail. I didn't think much of it until I realized he was probably a wanted fugitive and that's why he is always hiding"
NARCISISMO,What is opportunity to the man who can't use it?
NARCISISMO,"Dont you find it Funny that after Monday(M) and Tuesday(T), the rest of the week says WTF?"
NARCISISMO,"The truth is that our finest moments are most likely to occur when we are feeling deeply uncomfortable, unhappy, or unfulfilled. For it is only in such moments, propelled by our discomfort, that we are likely to step out of our ruts and start searching for different ways or truer answers"
NARCISISMO,"Read, every day, something no one else is reading. Think, everyday, something no one else is thinking. Do, every day, something no one else would be crazy enough to do."
NARCISISMO,Someday
NARCISISMO,"There is no better time than now. The time to live is now. The time to dream is now. The time to imagine and forget the past is now. The time to shine is now. The time to bleed, sweat, and determine yourself for the things you want most is now."
NARCISISMO,All things are subject to interpretation whichever interpretation prevails at a given time is a function of power and not truth.
NARCISISMO,All change is not growth; as all movement is not forward.

NARCISISMO,"Contra Costa County is now recruiting prison cooks at Caltech.  I didn't know they needed prison cooks that badly.  Besides, there's probably a 3.5 GPA requirement somewhere..."
NARCISISMO,"We consider a pure gas composed of rigid, nonattracting spherical molecules of diameter d and mass m, and the number density (number of molecules per unit volume) is taken to be n."
NARCISISMO,"Apparently ""California Institute of Technology"" is too long a name for MIT Graduate Admissions."

NARCISISMO,"Dear BioWare: Dragon Age is a wonderful and entertaining game, but epic fail on the load times.  At least make the wait entertaining.  Instead of blood tracks on a map (or awkward elevator rides), how about a 2D hack 'n slash minigame?"
